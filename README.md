## About the Video Course
Images bring a whole new level of excitement to an app. Without them, apps are dull and bland. In this course, you’ll not only learn to work with image files, but also how to access the camera on iOS devices to allow users to take pictures.

You’ll start by learning the fundamentals of working with images in Xcode. You’ll see how to import images and properly lay them out in your app storyboard files. Then you’ll learn how to access hardware on iOS devices to allow users to take images and save them.

We then bring everything together by creating a Collector app. This app allows a user to take an image of something, give it a proper name, and then use this as a database to reference the collection. This will reinforce what you previously learned and apply it to a fully functional practical app that uses Core Data to save images.
